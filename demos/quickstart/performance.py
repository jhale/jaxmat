# # Performance of CPU and GPU material integration
#
# This short demo reports the computational performance that can be expected
# when running `jaxmat` on a CPU or GPU for a batch of $N$ material
# points.

#
# The behavior is a finite-strain $\bF^\text{e}\bF^\text{p}$ elastoplastic
# model implemented in the `FeFpJ2Plasticity` behavior. We perform a monotonic
# strain-driven constitutive integration for 20 steps for $\epsilon=0$ to
# $5.10^{-2}$ for an isochoric tension:
#
# $$
# \bF = \diag(1+\epsilon, 1/\sqrt{1+\epsilon}, 1/\sqrt{1+\epsilon})
# $$
#
# ## Material model
#
# We briefly describe the equations of the `FeFpJ2Plasticity` model. More
# details can be found in {cite:p}`seidl2022calibration`.
#
# ### Evolution equations
#
# As stated before, the model is based on a $\bFe\bFp$ split of the total
# deformation gradient $\bF$. The plastic deformation is assumed to be
# isochoric so that $J=\det\bF=\det\bFe$. The elastic response is assumed to be
# hyperelastic and is expressed in terms of the Kirchhoff stress $\btau$ and
# its deviatoric part $\bs=\dev(\btau)$ as follows:
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
# \btau &= \bs + \dfrac{\kappa}{2}(J^2-1)\bI\\
# \bs &= \mu\dev{\bbebar}
# \end{align}
# $$
# where $\bbebar = J^{-2/3}\bbe$ with $\bbe=\bFe{\bFe}^\text{T}$ being the
# elastic left Cauchy-Green strain tensor.
#
# For the plastic part, we assume a von Mises-type $J_2$ plasticity with the
# following yield function:
#
# $$
# f(\btau;p) = \sqrt{\dfrac{3}{2}}\|\bs\| - R(p)
# $$
# where $p$ is the cumulated plastic strain and $R(p)$ a user-defined yield stress.
#
# The evolution of $p$ is given by the associated plastic flow rule, while the
# isotropic part evolution is given by the isochoric plastic condition
# $\det(\bbe)=J^2$.
#
# ### Discrete evolutions equations
#
# Discretization of the above evolution equations follows a procedure similar
# to the integration of small-strain elastoplastic models. In particular, we
# use the Fischer-Burmeister approach to enforce plastic consistency
# conditions.
#
# In our implementation, internal state variables are the cumulated plastic
# strain $p$ and the volume preserving elastic strain $\bbebar$. The latter is
# initialized with the identity tensor to specify a natural unstressed elastic
# configuration.
#
# We first compute an elastic stress predictor based on the relative
# deformation gradient given by:
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
# \boldsymbol{f}_{n+1} &= \bF_{n+1}(\bF_n)^{-1}\\
# \bar{\boldsymbol{f}}_{n+1} &= \det(\boldsymbol{f}_{n+1})^{-1/3}\boldsymbol{f}_{n+1}
# \end{align}
# $$
# where $\bF_n$ is the previous deformation gradient and $\bF_{n+1}$ the
# current one.
#
# Assuming an elastic evolution at first, the trial elastic strain is given by:
#
# $$
# \bbebar_\text{trial} = \bar{\boldsymbol{f}}_{n+1}^\text{T}\bbebar_n\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}_{n+1}
# $$
#
# For the new elastic strain $\bbebar$, the deviatoric stress is $\bs = \mu\dev(\bbebar)$.
#
# The yield condition is then given by:
# $$
# f(\bs) = \sqrt{\dfrac{3}{2}} \|\bs\| - R(p_n+\Delta p)
# $$
#
# The plastic consistency conditions are then encoded using the
# Fischer-Burmeister function $\text{FB}$ as:
#
# $$
# r_p = \text{FB}(-f(\bs),\Delta p) = 0
# $$
#
# Finally, the remaining discrete evolution equations are given following
# {cite:p}`seidl2022calibration` as:
#
# $$
# r_{\bbe} = \dev(\bbebar - \bbebar_\text{trial})
#   + \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{3}}\Delta p \operatorname{tr}(\bbebar) \dfrac{\bs}{\|\bs\|}
#   + \bI (\det(\bbebar) - 1) = 0
# $$
#
# Note that the first part of $r_{\bbe}$ is deviatoric only and enforce the
# plastic flow rule whereas the last term is purely spherical and enforces the
# plastic incompressibility condition. The nonlinear Newton system
# $(r_p,r_{\bbe})$ is then solved using `optimistix` for $\Delta p$ and
# $\bbebar$.
#
# Finally, the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress is obtained from the Kirchhoff
# stress as follows:
#
# $$
# \bP = \btau\bF^{-\text{T}}
# $$
#
# The tangent operator is again computed using AD which avoids us to compute
# explicitly the consistent tangent operator which is particularly nasty for
# such $\bFe\bFp$ models.
#
# ## Performance timing
#
# The constitutive integration is done for a batch of $N$ material points using
# `vmap` and is jitted. We also possibly compute the consistent tangent
# operator (case `jac`), otherwise only stress and state are computed without
# tangent operator (case `no_jac`). Computations are done in the
# {download}`generate_performance_data.py` script.
#
# Timing for integrating the whole batch is reported for each increment. Timing
# varies with increment number due to elastic vs. plastic regime but material
# parameters and loading amplitude are chosen to yield substantial plastic
# evolution. Note that a dummy integration is launched first to remove JIT
# compilation overhead from the reported timings.
#
# We report below the average timing per increment for the whole batch as a
# function of $N$. Simulations are run on a *Intel Core i7-12700H* (`"CPU"`) or
# on a single *NVIDIA RTX A1000 Laptop GPU* (`"GPU"`).

# We can clearly see a linear scaling in all cases with the batch size $N$. For
# large-scale problems, the GPU achieves a speedup of one to two orders of
# magnitude (10x--100x) compared to the CPU. At small batch sizes, the GPU
# curves remain nearly flat, indicating that the total computation time is
# dominated by kernel launch and data transfer overheads. In this regime, the
# GPU is underutilized. Once the workload becomes large enough to saturate the
# device, the computation time grows linearly, reflecting efficient parallel
# scaling and full hardware utilization.
#
# Finally, because of the smaller cost on GPU the jacobian overhead is more
# visible on the GPU log-log plots than for the CPU.
